If you haven’t already, set up a Git repository for your project with skeleton HTML/CSS and JS files. From here on out, we’ll assume that you have already done this.

All of your book objects are going to be stored in an array, so you’ll need a constructor for books. Then, add a separate function to the script (not inside the constructor) that can take some arguments, create a book from those arguments, and store the new book object into an array. Also, all of your book objects should have a unique id, which can be generated using crypto.randomUUID(). This ensures each book has a unique and stable identifier, preventing issues when books are removed or rearranged.
